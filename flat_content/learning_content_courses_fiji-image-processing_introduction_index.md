## Fiji Installation

Fiji is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms and can be downloaded directly
from the Fiji website: [https://fiji.sc/](https://fiji.sc/). Fiji is a portable application,
meaning it doesn't require an installer. To use Fiji, simply download and unzip the application,
and then you are able to start it.

* **macOS:** The Fiji application should be installed in the user’s home directory rather than the default Applications folder.
* **Windows 7 & 10:** The Fiji application should be installed in the user’s home directory rather than the default C:\Program Files directory.
* **Linux:** The Fiji application should be installed in a directory where the user has read, execution, and write permissions, e.g. the user’s home directory.

## Introduction

### Image Processing & Analysis

* Image Filtering (removal of noise and artifacts)
* Image Enhancement (highlight features of interest)
* Image Segmentation (object recognition)
* Quantitative Image Feature Description (object measurements)

**Image Processing Applications**

* Photography & cinematography
* Digitization of non-digital documents -> text mining
* Natural sciences, engineering
* Forensics, e.g. fingerprint matching
* Quality control, e.g. in semiconductor fabrication
* Satellite surveillance, e.g. weather forecasting, terrain usage analysis
* Autonomously operating machinery (cars, etc.)
* Automatic cataloging of pictures on the web

### The Digital Representation of an Image

* 2D images are 2D arrays of numbers organized in rows and columns
* The intersection of row and column is a pixel
* Each pixel is represented as an intensity value (e.g. between 0-255)

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-1.png" >}}

<br>

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-2.png" >}}

Fiji can handle image files in various file formats and pixel encodings, e.g. color images (RGB, HSB, etc.), grayscale images, and binary images.

***Color images*** use 8-bit encoding for each channel (e.g. RGB: 256 intensity values for red, green, and blue).

Pixels in ***grayscale images*** may be encoded as 8-bit integer (256 intensity levels), 16-bit integer (65536 intensity levels), or 32-bit float (decimal number) values.

***Binary images*** are a special type of 8-bit grayscale images that only contain the pixel values 0 (black) or 255 (white). They are used for masking and segmentation of object areas of interest in an image.

## Image Processing & Analysis

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-3.png" >}}

Image processing and analysis procedures often share a common workflow as shown here.

The original image (or raw data) that serves as input for the image processing pipeline may contain background noise that may need to be removed by applying specific image filters.

The cleaned-up image may then be processed to enhance certain features, e.g. highlight object edges.

The enhanced image can then be converted into binary image masks that define groups of pixels as objects. Based on these masks, objects of interest can be classified and analyzed for size, geometry, pixel intensities, etc..

* [Image Scale Bars](#image-scale-bars)


## Handling of Image Files

**Images and Image Stacks in Fiji**

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-4.png" >}}

## Working with Image Channels

Fiji has built-in tools to manipulate multichannel composite and RGB images. For this example, open the 5-dimensional (x, y, z, color, time) image stack.

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-5.png" >}}

1 Go to `File` > `Open Samples` > `Mitosis (26MB, 5D stack)`. An image window should open as shown here.

2 Open the Channels Tool dialog with `Image` > `Color` > `Channels Tool…`.

3 In the Channels Tool dialog window, change from `Composite` to `Color`. Move the channel slider and note how the display updates based on the selected channel.

4 Switch back to `Composite` mode. Uncheck selected channels and note how the channel overlay changes based on the selected images.

5 Change to `Grayscale`. Although the color information has been converted to gray, the **pixel intensity values remain unchanged**.

6 Change back to `Color`, Click `More >>`, select a new color.

7 Change to `Composite` mode.

<br>


**Splitting Channels**

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-6.png" >}}

1) Go to `File` > `Open Samples` > `Mitosis (26MB, 5D stack)`.

2) Go to `Image` > `Color` > `Split Channels`.

Individual image channels are displayed in separate windows. This operation only works on multichannel image stacks or RGB images.

<br>


**Merging Channels**

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-7.png" >}}

Images displayed in separate windows can be ***merged*** into multichannel composite images. The input ***images need to be of the same type*** (either 8-bit or 16-bit pixel encoding). You can merge up to 7 different images into a single multichannel image.

1) Go to `File` > `Open Samples` > `Fluorescent Cells`.

2) Go to `Image` > `Color` > `Split Channels`.

3) Go to `Image` > `Color` > `Merge Channels`.

4) Set the green channel to `None` and leave the other default settings. Click `OK`.

The resulting image should contain a merge of the red and blue channels without the green channel component.

<br>


**Changing Image Color Assignment**

The color representation in 8-bit and 16-bit images is defined by a color Lookup Table (LUT).

For **single channel images**, you can change the LUT by running these commands:

1) `Image` > `Lookup Tables`.

For a **multichannel image**, you can change the LUT by running these commands:

1) `Image` > `Color` > `Channels Tools`.

2) In the **Channels Tools** window, switch to `Color` mode and select a channel of interest.

3) Click `More >>`, select a new color.

<br>

### Image Montage and Cropping

**Making an Image Montage**
{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-8.png" >}}

Images can be laid out in a grid-like fashion, aka a ***montage***. Given the regular arrangement of the images in a grid layout, all image tiles used for the montage have to be of the same x-y dimension and same image type (e.g. all 8-bit, 8-bit, 32-bit, or RGB).

The easiest way to create a montage is to create an image stack that contains all the images for the individual image tiles and then use the Fiji Montage tool. Here is an example:

1) Close All Image Windows: `File` > `Close All`.

2) `File` > `Open Samples` > `Fluorescent Cells`.

3) `Image` > `Color` > `Split Channels`.

4) Close `Blue` Image.

5) Select `Red` Image.

6) Go to `Image` > `Lookup Tables` > `Grays`.

7) Select `Green` Image.

8) Go to `Image` > `Lookup Tables` > `Grays`.

9) `Image` > `Color` > `Merge Channels` (green and red channel); select `Keep Sources`.

10) For each of the three images:
  a) Click on grayscale image window to make it the active window,
  b) then go to `Image` > `Type` > `RGB Color`.

11) Go to `Image` > `Stacks` > `Images to Stack`.

12) Go to `Image` > `Stacks` > `Make Montage`.(Columns: 3, Scale factor: 1.0)

<br>

**Image Size: Cropping**

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-select-tools.png" >}}

Images can be cropped around regions-of-interest (ROIs) that can be drawn with the selection tools in the Fiji Toolbar.

1) Go to `File` > `Open Samples` and select any image.

2) Click **Rectangular selection icon**, then draw rectangular box in image.

3) Go to `Image` > `Crop`. This crops image to size of rectangular selection box.

Note that the image will be cropped for all z-focal planes, all channels, and all timepoints.




<br>


### Image Scale Bars

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-10.png" >}}

Many scientific instruments used for image acquisition store additional metadata in the image files that contain calibrations defining the size of a pixel (or 3D voxel) for that image or image stack in physical units (e.g. mm, nm, etc.). These values define the scale of an image.

Taking a look at the image window right below the image title indicates whether the image scale (e.g. pixel/voxel size) has been set or not.

* If the ***scale is not set***, the image dimensions are displayed as ***NNN x NNN pixels***, see top left panel.
* If the ***scale is set***, the image dimensions are displayed as ***NNN x NNN <physical unit>***, see bottom left panel.

<br>

**Defining an Image Scale**

You can set or modify an image's scale following these steps:

1) Go to `Analyze` > `Set Scale...`.

2) In the top box of the dialog window, enter the number of pixels that correspond to a known physical distance.

3) In the second box, enter the physical distance represented by the pixel distance.

4) Enter the physical units label, e.g. ***mm***, ***nm***, etc.. The label ***um*** is interpreted as micrometer.
* If `Global` is checked, the new scale (or scale removal) operation is **applied to all open images**.

5) Click `OK`.

<br>

**Adding a Scale Bar**

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-11.png" >}}

For presentation purposes it is frequently desired to display a scale bar in the image. This can be done following these steps:

1) Go to `Analyze` > `Tools` > `Scale Bar...`.

2) Define positioning of the scale bar and its size. Check the `Overlay` box and click `OK`.

2) Go to `Image` > `Overlay` > `Show Overlay/Hide Overlay` to toggle between showing and hiding the scale bar.

* The **Overlay** ***will not affect the pixel values*** of the image region under the scale bar.  It is **non-destructive**.

* Saving the image in TIF format retains the non-destructive overlay.

* Saving the image in JPG format burns the overlay into the image.

<br>

# Image Filtering & Enhancement

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-12.png" >}}

<br>

### Applying Filters: Noise Removal

Image noise is an undesirable by-product of image capture that adds spurious and extraneous information.

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-13.png" >}}

<br>

### How Do Filters Work?

Fiji provides several standard filters that can be applied to images. Here we are just exploring a few of them.

1) Open image file **noisy_image.tif** from the [Tutorial Example Files](#example-files).

2) Create three copies of the image file by pressing `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `D` (three times).

3) Go to `Process` > `Filters` and experiment with the `Mean`, `Median`, `Gaussian`, and `Unsharp Mask` filters on the four images.

4) Experiment with settings and click `Preview`.

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-14.png" >}}
{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-15.png" >}}

<br><br>

**Comparing Average (Mean) and Median Filters**

* **Mean**: Replaces pixel value with average value in kernel region.

* **Median**: Replaces pixel value with median value in kernel region.

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-16.png" >}}

<br>

**Other Commonly Used Filters**

| **Filter**                 | **Effect**                                                                    |
| ------                     | ------                                                                        |
| Convolve                   | Convolution with **custom** filter                                            |
| Gaussian Blur              | **Gaussian** filter, reasonable edge preservation                             |
| Median                     | **Median** of neighbors, non-linear, good for salt-and-pepper noise reduction |
| Mean                       | **Average** of neighbors, smoothing                                           |
| Minimum                    | **Smallest** value of neighbors, smoothing                                    |
| Maximum                    | **Largest** value of neighbors, smoothing                                     |
| Variance                   | **Variance** of neighbors, indicator of image textures, highlight edges       |

<br>

**Removing Periodic Noise (Advanced)**

Periodic noise as shown by the banding pattern observed in this image cannot be removed with the kernel-based standard filters described above. However applying ***Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT)*** analysis can reveal the periodicity of such noise represented by the high intensity spots in the FFT image (top middle panel). By masking these hotspots (bottom middle panel) and applying the inverse FFT one can retrieve the original image without the periodic noise (right panel).

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-17.png" >}}


### Applying Filters: Edge Detection

Edge detection is commonly used to define the outline of objects of interest. It is implemented by applying special convolution kernels.

**Note that edge detection algorithms can be very sensitive to noise. So it is generally advised to remove noise with other filters first (e.g. median filter which preserves edges quite well) before applying the edge detection filter (see images below).**

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-18.png" >}}


# Image Segmentation</a>

* Image Segmentation is the process that groups individual image pixels that represent specific objects.

* It often involves the application of a variety of image pixel filters.

* It requires binary (black and white) image masks and object shape descriptors (*morphometric* parameters).

<br>

### Example: Blob Analysis

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-19.png" >}}

To illustrate typical steps in image segmentation and analysis, we are going to process the ***blobs-shaded.tif*** image that is part of the [Tutorial Example Files] (#example-files).

**Analysis Goals:**

* Separate dark spots as individual objects from background.

* Reject small objects (debris) by size exclusion.

* Count total number of objects and compute average object size.

* Measure size (2D surface area) of each object.

<br>

### Separating "Blobs" from Background

In order to separate the dark spots from the background we will be using intensity thresholding. The idea is that all pixels with an intensity below (or equal) the threshold go in one bin, all other pixels go into another bin. Pixels in one bin are considered to belong to objects of interest while those in the other bin are considered background. This is the principal method to create binary images.

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-20.png" >}}


1) Open image file ***blobs-shaded.tif***.

2) In menu, go to `Image` > `Adjust` > `Threshold…`.

3) Click on image window, then click on `Auto` button in **Threshold** window. If you lost track of the Threshold window, goto `Windows` and select it from the list.

4) In the Threshold dialog window, uncheck the `Dark Background` box.  In the drop-down boxes select `Default` and `Red`.

5) Move the sliders and observe the change of the red pattern overlaying the image. Click `Reset` to remove the overlay. ***Don’t click Apply yet!***

* What is the problem?

<br>

### Correction of Uneven Background Signal

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-21.png" >}}

**A Background Correction Image**

1) Go to `Image` > `Duplicate`, in the `Title` box enter: **Bg**.

2) Go to `Process` > `Filters` > `Gaussian Blur…`.

* Check the `Preview` box.

* Try different `Sigma Radius` values: e.g. **1**, **20**, **100**.

3) Finally, set `Sigma Radius` to **60**.

4) Click `OK`.

<br>

**Performing the Background Correction**

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-22.png" >}}

5) Go to `Process` > `Image Calculator…`.

* From the `Image1` drop-down, select the ***blobs-shaded.tif*** image.

* Select the ***Divide*** Operation.

* From the `Image2` drop-down, select the ***Bg*** image.

* Check the `Create new window` box.

* Check the `32-bit (float) result` box.

* Click `OK`.

6) Click on the ***resulting*** window that contains the corrected image.

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-23.png" >}}

7) Go to `Image` > `Rename...` and enter ***Corr*** as a new name for the corrected image.

8) Go to `Image` > `Type` > `8-bit` to change the image from 32-bit float to 8-bit integer encoding.

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-24.png" >}}

<br>


### Creating a Binary Object Mask

9) Go to `Process` > `Binary` > `Options`. Check the `Black background` box and click `OK`. This controls the display mode of ***thresholded images*** and also the mode that the ***Particle Analyzer*** uses to identify objects (see below). **In our example objects of interest will be displayed white on black background.**

10) Go to `Image` > `Adjust Threshold`.

* In the Threshold dialog window, choose the ***Default*** algorithm.

* Choose the ***Red*** overlay.

* Deselect `Dark Background` and deselect `Stack histogram`.

* Click on the ***Corr*** image window and click `Auto` in the Threshold window. Note the uniform detection of dark spots indicated by the red overlay. Note the bimodal distribution of the pixel intensity values in the thresholding histogram. Compare this thresholding to the one obtained for the original image ***blobs-shaded.tif***.

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-25.png" >}}
{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-27.png" >}}
{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-28.png" >}}

<br>

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-29.png" >}}

11) In the Threshold dialog window, click `Apply`.

* If you see a message like: **“Convert to 8-bit mask or set background pixels to NaN”**, it means that you are running the thresholding on a 32-bit image.  Convert the ***Corr*** image to 8-bit first (see step 8).

* If you see black objects on white background, check `Process` > `Binary` > `Options` (step 9).

* Redo the thresholding on **“Corr”** image.

12) Go to `Image` > `Rename` and enter ***Mask*** as a new image title.

The result after steps 1-12 should be a binary mask image that shows white bobs on a black background.

<br>

### Splitting Joined Objects

The previous steps produced a binary mask, but closer inspection reveals that some blob objects are fused. These appear as peanut-shaped objects. We will apply a watershed algorithm to separate these fused objects.

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-32.png" >}}

13) Click on the ***Mask*** image window and go to `Process` > `Binary` > `Watershed`.

14) Save the image obtained after the watershed operation as **blobs-watershed.tif**.

* The watershed algorithm only works on binary images, e.g. the black and white “blob” mask.

* It only works for objects that show significant opposing convex-to-concave curvature (neck regions).


<br>


### Analyze Particles

Now we are ready to identify and extract information from each blob.

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-34.png" >}}
{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-33.png" >}}

15) Go to `Analyze` > `Analyze Particles...`.

* In the **Analyze Particles** dialog, set up the analysis parameters as shown.

* Click `OK`.

The option **Show** `Outlines` leads to the creation of a new image that contains the outline and object ID (red numbers).

The option `Add to Manager` sends the definition for each identified particle, i.e. dark blob, to the **Region-of-Interest Manager**, (ROI Manager for short).

<br>

### The ROI Manager

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-35.png" >}}

Regions-of-interest (ROIs) define groups of pixels in an image. ROIs can have different shapes, e.g. line, rectangular, ellipsoid, polygonal, text, or irregular. An ROI can be used to

* Measure pixel values in a specific image region.
* Change pixel values in a specific image region.
* Mark image regions in non-destructive overlays (without changing pixel values).

When we use the Particle Analyzer with the `Add to Manager` option, the ROI for each blob is sent to the Roi Manager.

**ROI Properties**

Via the `Properties` button, the ROI Manager provides functions to change properties of selected ROIs, e.g. name, Z-position, outline color & width, and fill color. Multiple ROIs can be selected by holding the `Ctrl` (`command` on a Mac) or `Shift` keys while clicking on the ROIs.

**ROI Import & Export**

The ROI Manager can save selected ROIs to a file or open ROIs from a file. Typically, the ROI files have a .roi or .zip extension. The **Open** & **Save** functions are available after clicking the `More>>` button in the ROI Manager.

* `Save`: Export All Selected ROIs to File

* `Open`: Import ROIs from ROI file

* This only affects **selected ROI**.

* If **no ROIs are selected**, new properties are be applied to all ROIs in Manager.

<br>

# Image Object Measurements

### Set Measurements

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-37.png" >}}

Fiji can measure a variety of parameters for each region-of-interest, or an entire image. The specific measurements to be calculated by the Particle Analyzer can be set in the **Set Measurements** dialog.

1) Go to `Analyze` > `Set Measurements...`.

* Adjust settings as shown in screenshot. Click `OK`.

* Settings affect future measurements, not existing ones.

2) For quick measurements, draw a selection on the image and press `Ctrl` + `M`.

* Measurements occur for **current selected region in the current image**.

**Example:**

1) Draw a selection on image

2) Use `Ctrl` + `M`.

3) Change settings in **Set Measurements** window.

4) Use `Ctrl` + `M`.

5) Select an ROI in the ROI Manager. Click `Measure` or use `Ctrl` + `M` to create measurements for the currently selected ROI.

<br>

### Analyze Particles with Custom Parameters

The Particle Analyzer allows filtering of identified ROIs by size and circularity (range 0.0-1.0). A perfect circle has a circularity of 1.0. Let's filter the identified blobs and discard any ROI that has an area <150 square pixels.

1) Go to `Edit` > `Selection` > `Select None` (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `A`).

2) Go to `Analyze` > `Analyze Particles...`.

3) In the **Analyze Particles** dialog window, set up the analysis parameters as shown in the screenshot.

4) Click `OK`.

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-38.png" >}}

Based on our selection, the Particle Analyzer creates two results tables, titled **Results** and **Summary**. The type of  measurements computed (e.g. **Mean**, **Median**, etc.) depend on the settings in the **Set Measurements** dialog.

* Each line in the **Results** table reflects measurements for a single ROI.

* The **Summary** table, as the name implies, provides summary statistics for all ROIs.

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-39.png" >}}

<br>

### Measuring Pixel Intensities

Let's go back and modify the measurement selection.

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-40.png" >}}

1) Go to `Analyze` > `Set Measurements...`.

2) In the `Set Measurements` dialog window, set up the analysis parameters as shown in the screenshot.

3) Click `OK`.

4) Select all ROIs:

* Go to `Window` > `ROI Manager`.
* Click on first ROI, **hold Shift** key,
* Scroll down, click last ROI in list.

5) Measure ROIs in the **Mask** image

* Click on black/white **mask** image
* In **ROI Manager** window, click `Measure`. This adds measurements for all selected ROIs to the **Results** table.
* Click on the **Results** window, go to `File` > `Rename`, and enter **Mask-Results** as a new name.
* If you don’t rename the window, the Results will be overwritten by new measurements.

6) Measure ROIs in the **original** image

* Click on **blobs-shaded.tif** image
* In **ROI Manager** window, click `Measure`. This adds measurements for all selected ROIs to the **Results** table.

<br>

Now we can compare the intensity measurements for the corresponding ROIs in the **Mask** and the **blobs-shaded.tif** images.

* What do you observe?

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-41.png" >}}

### Additional ROI Manager Functions

* ROIs that are listed in the ROI Manager window can be saved to a file (single ROI or multiple ROIs).
* Conversely, ROIs can be loaded from file into the ROI Manager and (re-)applied to an image.
* Hand-drawn ROIs created with the ROI tools can be added to the ROI-Manager.
* ROIs can be renamed and colored.
* ROIs can be combined to create ROIs with complex shapes.

Go to the [Exercises](#exercises) section for ideas to explore ROI-Manager functionality.

# 3D Image Reconstruction

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-42.png" >}}

### Isolating the Brain Segmentation

{{< figure src="/courses/fiji-image-processing/introduction/intro-fiji-43.png" >}}

### Creating the Brain Segmentation

1) Apply gaussian filter (0.5).

2) Apply local thresholding (Grey Median, Otsu).

3) Run particle analysis (1000-infinity particle size).

4) Manual clean up segmentation mask as needed.

5) Save brain segmentation mask as TIF image stack.

These steps have been executed for you. The resulting brain segmentation mask is saved as **brain-mask.tif** in the [Tutorials Example Files](#example-files).

### Creating the Composite 3D Rendering

1) Go to `File` > `Open Samples` > `T1-Head`.

2) Go to `Image` > `Type` > `8-bit`.

3) Go to `File` > `Open` and select **brain-mask.tif** [see Tutorials Example Files](#example-files).

4) Go to `Process` > `Image Calculator`:

* Select **t1-head.tif** as Image 1.
* Select the **AND** operation.
* Select **brain-mask.tif** as Image 2.
* Check the `Create new window` box.

This will create a new grayscale window with the brain proper that corresponds to the mask.

5) Go to `Image` > `Color` > `Merge Channels`: t1-head.tif (gray), brain (magenta)

6) Go to `Plugins` > `3D Viewer`.

* Select `Display as Volume`. Leave the other default settings.

8) In 3D Viewer, go to `Edit` > `Change Transparency`: Change skull transparency to 75%.

9) Go to `View` > `Create 360 degree animation` to view a rotating animation of the rendered head volume.

# Exercises

### 1. Saving files in different file formats
Fiji supports many different file formats.

1) Use **File** > **Open Samples** to open an image of your choosing

2) Go to **File** > **Save As** and pick a file format to export the current image to.

Note that some image file formats use compression algorithms that may reduce the pixel resolution or
dynamic range of an image’s intensity values. The TIF file format is very versatile because it can store
image data without resolution loss, it can handle multi-image files (i.e. image stacks or multi-page),
store image annotations as file internal metadata, and can be read by many programs.
File import/export functionality is further extended by the Bio-Formats plugin (Plugins > Bio-Formats).
See [https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/6.0.0/](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/6.0.0/)

### 2. Image Channels

**2.1 Splitting and Merging Channels**

1) Go to **File** > **Open Samples** > **Mitosis** (26MB, 5D stack).

2) Go to **Image** > **Color** > **Split Channels.**

3) Go to **Image** > **Color** > **Merge**, merge the two channels but assign new colors to each channel.

What happens if you assign one of the images to multiple different colors?

<br>

**2.2 Manipulating Color Lookup Tables**

Color lookup tables (LUTs) can be used on 8-bit grayscale, 16-bit grayscale, and 8-bit Color images. Note that 8-
bit color is not the same as RGB color. LUTs for 16-bit grayscale will be resampled to 8-bit (256 colors).

1) Go to **File** > **Open Samples** > **Clown**

2) Go to **Image** > **Zoom** > **In**.

3) Go to **Image** > **Color** > **Edit LUT**.

Did this work? Look at the image information in the clown.jpg window. Alternatively, go to **Image > Show
information** and look at the **Bits per pixel** entry. What is the image format?

4) Click on the clown.jpg image and convert the image to 8-bit color (**Image > Type > 8-bit Color**) Keep 256
colors (the default). Click **OK**.

5) Go to **Image > Color > Edit LUT**. The window shows the LUT color palette

6) Double-click on a LUT tile and edit its RGB values to pure blue. Click **OK** and repeat this for other LUT
entries, change the color representation as you wish.

What do you observe?

<br>

### 3. Image Montage

For this exercise we are creating a montage of RGB images, each image representing the center focal plane at a
single timepoint within an x-y-color-t timelapse series. Experiment with creating different image tile sizes and
border widths.

1) **Close** all images (**File** > **Close All**).

2) Go to **File** > **Open Samples** > **Mitosis** (26MB, 5D stack).

3) Go to **Image** > **Type** > **RGB Color**. Keep all slices and frames selected.

4) Go to **Image** > **Duplicate**. Check the **Duplicate Hyperstack** box, enter **Slices (z): 3** (central focal plane),
enter **Frames (t): 1-51**. Click **OK**.

5) Click on the newly created stack. It should contain images for a single focal plane over multiple
timepoints (frames).

6) Save this image stack as a TIF file to your hard drive so you can create new montage layouts without
having to go through steps 1-5 again.

7) Go to **Image** > **Stacks** > **Make Montage**. In the dialog box set the following values:

* **Columns**: 10
* **Rows**: 6
* **Scale factor**: 0.25
* **Border width**: 5
* Check **Use foreground color**

8) Click **OK**.

Select the image stack created in step 5 (or reopen the stack saved in step 6) and create new montages with
modified montage settings. To change the foreground color for the border, double-click on the **Color Picker** in
the Fiji toolbar.

### 4. Image Scale Bars

Scale bars can be added to any image. Before a scale bar can be drawn, the pixel size has to be defined.

1) Go to **File** > **Open Sample** and select an image.

2) Repeat step 1 and open a second image.

3) Go to **Analyze** > **Set Scale**.

4) If the image does not have a scale bar, the entries for **Distance in pixels** and **Known distance** will be set
to zero values and **Scale** label will show <no scale> at the bottom the dialog box.

5) Change the values for **Distance in pixels** and **Known distance** to non-zero values. Leave the **Global** box
unchecked.

6) Enter a value for **Unit of length**. This can be any character sequence. If you enter “**um**” (without the
quotes) the unit will be set to **μm**.

7) Click **Ok**.

Look at the active image window (currently in front). The scale is indicated below the window title. The scale of
the second window should remain unaltered.

8) Go to **Analyze** > **Set Scale** again.

9) Change the **Distance in pixels**, **Known distance**, and **Unit of length** values.

10) Check the **Global** box.

11) Click **Ok**.

Note that the scale has changed for all open images. To remove a scale bar from an image, go to **Analyze** > **Set
Scale** and press the **Click to Remove Scale** button. If the **Global box** is checked, it will remove the scale on all
open images, otherwise the scale will be removed for the current image only.

<br>

### 5. Custom Image Filters

To apply a filter to images, a convolution kernel has to be created. The built-in filters have standardized
convolution kernels. You can create your own convolution kernels to create custom filters. In this example we
create a simple edge detector, called the Sobel operator.

1) Open the noisy.tif image.

2) Apply a filter to remove the salt-and-pepper noise, e.g. with the median filter.

3) Duplicate the image.

4) Go to **Process** > **Filters** > **Convolve**.

5) In the **textfield** of the dialog box, enter these numbers (**each number separated by a white space**).

-1 0 1

-2 0 2

-1 0 1

6) Check the **Preview** box. Experiment with changing the kernel values; make sure to keep the square
matrix format.

7) Click **OK**.
What edges are highlighted in the image? Can you modify the kernel to detect the missing vertical edges?
8) Create another kernel with these values and apply it to the copied image obtained in step 3:

-1 -2 -1

0 0 0

1 2 1

What edges are being detected now?

9) Go to **Process** > **Image Calculator**.

10) Select the output image from step 7 as Image 1.

11) Change **Operation** to **Max**.

12) Select the output image from step 8 as Image 2.

13) Check the **Create new window** box.

14) Check the **32-bit (float) result** box.

15) Click **OK**.

The resulting image should show a combination of edges detected in steps 7 and 8. Can you create four kernels
to detect all vertical and horizontal edges?

<br>

### 6. Image Segmentation & Object Measurements

For this exercise we assume that we already have a binary mask (thresholded) image, and we will use the
Particle Analyzer for image segmentation and object measurements.

1) Open the **blobs-watershed.tif** image. This should be a binary image.

2) Go to **Analyze** > **Set Measurements** and change the selection of measurement options.

3) Go to **Analyze** > **Analyze Particles** and modify the **Size (pixel^2)**, **Circularity** (1.0 refers to perfect circular
shaped objects), and **Show** options.

4) Click **OK**.

5) Repeat steps 2-4 and experiment with different settings.

Depending on your selection you will see a results table with data for each detected object (if **Display results** is
checked), a summary table for all results (if **Summarize** is checked), and the ROI-Manager (if **Add to Manager** is
checked) with a list of ROIs corresponding to the individual objects.

6) Go to **File** > **Open Samples** > **Blobs**.

7) Click on the **blobs-watershed.tif** image.

8) Go to **Analyze** > **Set Measurements**, check the Min & max gray value and the Mean gray value boxes,
and change the Redirect to option to blobs.gif. This means that object detection is performed on the
blobs-watershed.tif binary mask, but pixel intensity measurements will be performed on the blobs.gif
image due to the redirect.

9) Go to **Analyze** > **Analyze Particles**. Click **OK**.

Repeat the measurement results with and without redirect and compare the changes in the results for **Min &
max gray value** and the **Mean gray value.**

<br>

### 7. ROI Manager

The ROI Manager is very useful to handle multiple ROIs. It allows saving/loading ROIs and also to
combine simple shaped ROIs into more complex ones.

1) Open an image of your choice.

2) Use any of the selection tools from the Fiji toolbar to draw a selection area onto
the image.

3) Go to **Selection** > **Edit** > **Add to Manager**. This will add the current selection to the ROI
Manager.

4) Draw a new region of interest and go to **Selection** > **Edit** > **Add to Manager**.

<br>

**7.1 Saving ROIs to file**

The ROI Manager should show two ROIs.

5) In the ROI Manager, click on one of the ROIs.

6) In the ROI Manager, click **More>>** and then **Save**. In the dialog box enter a name for the ROI file and
click Save.

7) In the ROI Manager, hold the Shift key and select both ROIs.

8) Click **More>>** and then **Save**. In the dialog box enter a name for the ROI file and click **Save**. This will save
multiple ROI definitions into a single file.

**Notes:**

* For a single ROI, the default ROI file extension is **.roi**. For multiple ROIs, the default file extension is **.zip.**

* If none of the ROIs are selected, the operations in the ROI Manager are applied to all ROIs.

<br>

**7.2 Opening ROIs from file**
1) In the ROI Manager, select all ROIs and click **Delete**.

2) Click on **More>>** and then click **Open**. Select the ROI file saved under exercise 7.1 step 8 (multiple ROIs).

3) Click on one of the ROIs in the ROI Manager. This should create corresponding selection in the current
image.

**Note:** You can open another image and reload saved ROIs to apply them to the new current image.

<br>

**7.3 Changing ROI display properties**
Each ROI has multiple properties, e.g. position, color, etc.

1) In the ROI Manager, select the first ROI (or reload from file).

2) Click on Properties.

3) Change the **Name** to ROI\_1, the **Stroke color** to blue, and the **width** to 2. Click **OK**.

4) Select the second ROI.

5) Click on Properties.

6) Change the **Name** to ROI\_2, the **Stroke color** to red, the **width** to 1, and the **Fill color** to cyan. Click **OK**.

7) Click **OK**.

If you have multiple ROIs selected OR none at all, the properties will be applied to all ROIs.

<br>

**7.4 Combining ROIs**

Simple ROI shapes can be combined into more complex ones.

1) In the current image, draw a new selection that partially overlaps the first ROI.

2) Add the selection to the ROI Manager. It should show as the last one in the ROI Manager list.

3) In the ROI Manager, hold the **Ctrl** (Windows) or **Command** (Mac) key and click on the first and
third ROI.

4) A context menu should pop up; if not, click on **More >>**. In the ROI Manager’s context menu,
select **OR (Combine)**. The menu will disappear. In the ROI Manager, click on **Add [t]** button. A
new ROI will appear at the bottom of the ROI Manager list.

5) Select the last ROI in the list (the one you just created). It encompasses the combined area of
the first and third ROI.

6) Repeat steps 3 and 4 but choose different ROI combination methods, e.g. **And, XOR**. The **And**
operation produces a new ROI that contains only the overlapping region of the selected ROIs,
while the **XOR** operation creates a combined ROI that excludes any overlap between the
selected ROIs.
